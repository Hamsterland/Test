# Shortening in Subsequent Mentions

### Information

For new acronyms, you would like to introduce in your synopsis for words (like names of fictional organizations) frequently used, use the full name of the show first followed by the abbreviated form in parentheses, and then use the abbreviated form in subsequent mentions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unless it is an acronym used in the anime/manga, do not shorten names with more than three words.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Introduce the abbreviation between parentheses even for initializations of names with three words or fewer.
{% endhint %}

### Examples

**First Mention**

Shiro is a cadet in the Royal Space Force (RSF).&#x20;
